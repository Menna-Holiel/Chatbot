"# Chatbot" 
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built with FastAPI and Streamlit, using the Together AI LLaMA 3.3-70B model to generate responses. The FastAPI backend handles user prompts and communicates with the AI model, while the Streamlit frontend provides a simple, interactive chat interface with persistent conversation history and real-time loading indicators.
